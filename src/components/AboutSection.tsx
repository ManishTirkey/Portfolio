        Hello! I'm a creative developer passionate about building beautiful, interactive web experiences. 
        I specialize in modern frontend technologies and love creating interfaces with glass-like effects and smooth animations.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        My background spans across UI/UX design and frontend development, with expertise in React, TypeScript, 
        and various modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new design trends, listening to music, 
        and finding inspiration in both digital and physical spaces.
